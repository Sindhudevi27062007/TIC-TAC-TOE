#Description:

Tic-Tac-Toe, also known as Noughts and Crosses, is a classic two-player strategy game where players take turns marking spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. One player uses 'X' and the other uses 'O', with the goal of placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row.

This project is a digital implementation of Tic-Tac-Toe, developed using programming languages such as Python, Java, or JavaScript, with options for single-player (vs AI) or two-player modes.
